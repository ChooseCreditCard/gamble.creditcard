        <h1>Why Gambling on Credit Is Especially Risky</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          Some card transactions are treated as “gambling” or “cash-like” by issuers. This often means extra fees,
          higher interest and a faster path into problem debt. This page explains the mechanics – without encouraging
          gambling or credit use.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>How Gambling Transactions Are Treated on Credit Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on country and issuer, gambling-related transactions may be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blocked entirely, especially on credit cards or for certain types of gambling.</li>
        <li>Allowed, but classified as “cash advances” or similar high-risk categories.</li>
        <li>Subject to higher interest rates, extra fees or no interest-free grace period.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Regulators in several markets have specifically questioned or restricted the use of credit cards for gambling,
        because combining easy access to credit with high-risk betting can accelerate financial harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exact treatment depends on your card issuer and local rules. You always need to read their documentation
        and terms – this page is only a general overview.
      </p>

    <!-- Debt & credit impact -->
    <section id="impacts" class="section">
      <h2>Debt, Credit Scores & Long-Term Impact</h2>
      <p>
        From a credit perspective, gambling on credit cards creates several layers of risk:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fast-growing balances:</strong> repeated gambling transactions can push utilisation high and
          make it harder to pay the balance in full each month.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Higher interest and fees:</strong> if transactions are treated like cash advances, they may start
          accruing interest immediately and include extra charges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stress on repayment behaviour:</strong> missed payments or only paying the minimum can hurt your
          credit score and signal financial stress to future lenders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Knock-on effects:</strong> high card balances can reduce flexibility for emergencies or necessary
          spending and may trigger limit reductions or declined applications.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once debt has built up, it often takes months or years of careful repayment behaviour to repair both the
        balance and the credit record.
      </p>

    <!-- Questions & safer thinking -->
    <section id="questions" class="section">
      <h2>Questions to Ask Before You Mix Gambling and Credit</h2>
      <p>
        This site does not recommend gambling or tell you how to use cards. Instead, it suggests questions that can
        highlight the risks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Would I still place this bet if I had to pay it in cash today, not on credit?</li>
        <li>Can I comfortably pay the full card balance – including any fees – on the next due date?</li>
        <li>How would my finances look if I lost this money and then had to pay interest on it?</li>
        <li>Does my issuer classify gambling as cash advances with higher costs?</li>
        <li>Is gambling starting to affect my sleep, relationships or ability to pay other bills?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are worried about gambling or debt, independent help services in your country can offer confidential,
        non-judgmental support. Look for official addiction helplines or debt counselling rather than informal advice
        on social media.
